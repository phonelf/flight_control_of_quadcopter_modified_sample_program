# Arduino AT24C1024 EEPROM Library
This is a library to support the AT24C1024 EEPROM. Up to 4 of these devices may be chained together to provide 128-512 kilobytes of EEPROM storage.

The usage is based on the Arduino EEPROM library and two I2C EEPROM libraries. If you're familiar with how that works, using this library should be pretty straightforward. Basically just substitute EEPROM1024 where you were using EEPROM.

**For example, this:**
```
EEPROM.write(address, value);
```
**becomes:**
```
EEPROM1024.write(address, value);
```

## Credits
This library is based on several projects:
* [The Arduino EEPROM library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM)
* [The 24C256 library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/I2CEEPROM)
* [The 24C512 library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/I2CEEPROM24LC512)

## Install
* Unzip the download into your Arduino library directory
* If the Arduino IDE is already running then exit and restart the Arduino IDE

## Examples
